Mulang
======
> A universal, multi-language, multi-paradigm code analyzer

Mulang is three different  - but highly related - things:

  * an intermediate language, known as the [Mulang AST](./astspec/);
  * a [command line tool](./userguide/#command-line-tool) for analysing the Mulang AST and [some popular languages](./userguide/#supported-languages) by transforming to it. This tool is distributed as both a `linux-amd64` binary and a JavaScript package. See [downloads section](https://github.com/mumuki/mulang/releases).
  * a Haskell composable [combinators library](./userguide/#combinators-crash-course) for analysing the Mulang AST;
