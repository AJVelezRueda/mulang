# Supported inspections

The power of Mulang is grounded on more than 70 different kind of inspections:

| Inspection                        | Paradigm           | Meaning
|-----------------------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------
| `assigns`                         |  any               | the given variable or attribute assigned?

# Command Line Tool

You can also use Mulang from the Command Line, without having to interact with Haskell code. This tool allows to perform most common analysis out of the box by using a JSON spec. It supports four different kinds of analysis:

1. **Expectation analysis**: you can pass _inspections_ that will be tested against the provied program. Expectations answer questions like: _does the function X call the function Y?_ or _does the program use if's?_.
4. **Smell analysis**: instead of asking explcit questions to the program, the smells analysis implicitly runs specific inspections - that denote bad code - in orden to know if any of them is matched.
2. **Intermediate Language analysis**: you can ask the tool to generate the Mulang AST for a given source code.
3. **Signature analysis**: report the signatures of the computations present in source code.

## The expectations DSL

In order to pass expectations to the Command Line Tool, you must use a simple DSL that builds the inspections for you.

| Kind        | DSL Sample                  | Haskell Combinators Sample
|-------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------
| Basic       | `* UsesIf`                  |  `usesIf`
| Negated     | `* Not:UsesWhile`           | `(negative usesWhile)`
| Predicated  | `* DeclaresClass:Foo`       | `(declaresClass (named "Foo"))`
|             | `* DeclaresClass:=Foo`      | `(declaresClass (named "Foo"))`
|             | `* DeclaresClass:~Foo`      | `(declaresClass (like "Foo"))`
|             | `* DeclaresClass:^Foo`      | `(declaresClass (except "Foo"))`
|             | `* DeclaresClass:[Foo\|Bar]` | `(declaresClass (anyOf ["Foo", "Bar"]))`
|             | `* DeclaresClass:*`         | `(declaresClass anyone)`
|             | `* DeclaresClass`           | `(declaresClass anyone)`
| Transitive  | `foo UsesLambda`            | `(transitive usesLambda "foo")`
| Scoped      | `Intransitive:foo UsesIf`   | `(scoped usesIf "foo")`
| Scoped List | `foo.bar UsesIf`            | `(scopedList usesIf ["foo", "bar"])`


## Examples

Let's see some usage samples:

### With intransitive expectations

$ mulang '
{
   "sample" : {
      "tag" : "CodeSample",
      "language" : "Haskell",
      "content" : "x = 1"
   },
   "spec" : {
      "expectations" : [
         {
            "binding" : ":Intransitive:x",
            "inspection" : "Uses:*"
         }
      ],
      "smellsSet" : { "tag" : "NoSmells" }
   }
}
' | json_pp

            {
              "tag" : "Variable",
              "contents" : [
                "x",
                { "tag" : "MuNumber", "contents" : 1 }
              ]
            },
            {

   "smells" : [],
   "tag" : "AnalysisCompleted",
   "signatures" : [
      "-- x",
      "-- y"
   ]
}
```

### With Smell Analysis, by inclusion

```bash
$ mulang '
{
   "sample" : {
      "tag" : "CodeSample",
      "language" : "JavaScript",
      "content" : "function foo(x, y) { return null; }"
   },
   "spec" : {
      "expectations" : [],
      "smellsSet" : {
        "tag" : "NoSmells",
        "include" : [
          "ReturnsNil",
          "DoesNullTest"
        ]
      },
      "signatureAnalysisType" : {
        "tag" : "StyledSignatures",
        "style" : "HaskellStyle"
      }
   }
}
' | json_pp
{
   "tag" : "AnalysisCompleted",
   "expectationResults" : [],
   "signatures" : [
      "-- foo x y"
   ],
   "smells" : [
      {
         "binding" : "foo",
         "inspection" : "ReturnsNil"
      }
   ]
}
```

### With Smell Analysis, by exclusion

```bash
$ mulang '
{
   "sample" : {
      "tag" : "CodeSample",
      "language" : "JavaScript",
      "content" : "function foo(x, y) { return null; }"
   },
   "spec" : {
      "expectations" : [],
      "smellsSet" : {
        "tag" : "AllSmells",
        "exclude" : [
          "ReturnsNil"
        ]
      },
      "signatureAnalysisType" : {
        "tag" : "StyledSignatures",
        "style" : "HaskellStyle"
      }
   }
}
' | json_pp
{
   "smells" : [],
   "signatures" : [
      "-- foo x y"
   ],
   "tag" : "AnalysisCompleted",
   "expectationResults" : []
}
```

### With expressiveness smells

Expressivnes smells are like other smells - they can be included or excluded using the `smellsSet` settings. However, their behaviour is also controlled
by the `domainLanguage` setting, which you _can_ configure:

```bash
$ mulang '
{
   "sample" : {
      "tag" : "CodeSample",
      "language" : "Prolog",
      "content" : "son(Parent, Son):-parentOf(Son, Parent).parentOf(bart, homer)."
   },
   "spec" : {
      "expectations" : [],
      "smellsSet" : { "tag" : "AllSmells" },
      "domainLanguage" : {
         "caseStyle" : "SnakeCase",
         "minimumIdentifierSize" : 4,
         "jargon" : ["id"]
      }
   }
}' | json_pp
{
   "tag" : "AnalysisCompleted",
   "signatures" : [],
   "smells" : [
      {
         "inspection" : "HasTooShortIdentifiers",
         "binding" : "son"
      },
      {
         "binding" : "parentOf",
         "inspection" : "HasWrongCaseIdentifiers"
      }
   ],
   "expectationResults" : []
}
```

Also, if you want to use `HasMisspelledIdentifiers` smell, you _need_ to specify a dictionary - with must be ordered, downcased and with unique words only:

```bash
$ mulang  '
{
   "sample" : {
      "tag" : "CodeSample",
      "language" : "JavaScript",
      "content" : "function foo(x, y) { return null; }"
   },
   "spec" : {
      "expectations" : [],
      "smellsSet" : { "tag" : "AllSmells" },
      "domainLanguage" : { "dictionaryFilePath" : "/usr/share/dict/words" }
   }
}' | json_pp
{
   "tag" : "AnalysisCompleted",
   "expectationResults" : [],
   "signatures" : [],
   "smells" : [
      {
         "inspection" : "ReturnsNil",
         "binding" : "foo"
      },
      {
         "inspection" : "HasMisspelledIdentifiers",
         "binding" : "foo"
      }
   ]
}
```


### With Intermediate Language Generation

```bash
$ mulang '
{
   "sample" : {
      "tag" : "CodeSample",
      "language" : "JavaScript",
      "content" : "function foo(x, y) { return null; }"
   },
   "spec" : {
      "expectations" : [],
      "smellsSet" : { "tag" : "NoSmells" },
      "includeIntermediateLanguage" : true
